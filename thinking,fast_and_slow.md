## 1 - Introduction
### the two types of systems
- *System1* runs automatically, quickly, continually generates cues for *System2* --- impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into actions.
- *System2* normally runs in a low effort mode, engaged when needed to perform effortful mental activities. System2  is also responsible for monitoring ones own behaviour: the control that keeps you polite when you're angry. System2 is incharge of self control. It controls the impulses of System1.
- When system1 is in trouble system2 is engaged to support the problem at hand. Ex: `17 *24`. Also, System2 is activated when an event that violates the model of the world that System1 perceives. Ex: `Gorilla experiment`.

- *Visual Illusion* : Both the lines are of the same length however *System1* perceives them to be of different lengths.
- *Cognitive Illusion* : “our excessive confidence in what we believe we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in”
